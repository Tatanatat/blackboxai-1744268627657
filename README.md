# Hostel Channel Manager

## Project Overview

Hostel Channel Manager is a web application designed to facilitate the management of reservations for hostels. The tool provides an intuitive interface for managing reservations, tracking statistics on bookings, and filtering options. It supports a dual view for displaying reservations: a table view and a calendar view, enhancing usability and accessibility for hostel administrators.

## Installation

To set up the Hostel Channel Manager locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hostel-channel-manager.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd hostel-channel-manager
   ```

3. **Open the index.html file in your browser** to view the application:
   ```bash
   open index.html   # For MacOS
   xdg-open index.html # For Linux
   start index.html  # For Windows
   ```

The project does not require any additional installations since it operates on standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

Once the application is open in your browser, you will see a dashboard displaying the following:

- Confirmed Reservations
- Pending Reservations
- Occupied Rooms
- Total Revenue

You can switch between the "Table View" and "Calendar View" for better visualization of the reservations. Use the search bar and dropdowns to filter reservations based on the guest name, room, and status.

### Editing and Canceling Reservations

To edit or cancel a reservation:

1. Click the edit button (pencil icon) on the respective reservation row.
2. To cancel, click the cancel button (cross icon) and confirm your action.

## Features
